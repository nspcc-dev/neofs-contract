# Project-specific labels

## Component

We naturally have a set of contracts here, so each contract has a label of its
own (the same color is used for each except `neofs` since it's not an FS chain
contract, they rarely mix in a single issue):

- alphabet
- audit

  Should not be used for new issues since the contract is gone, but kept for
  old ones.
- balance
- container
- neofs
- neofsid
- netmap
- nns
- proxy
- reputation
- subnet

  Should not be used for new issues since the contract is gone, but kept for
  old ones.
